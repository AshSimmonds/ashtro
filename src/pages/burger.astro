            <pre>States should be adjectives aka describing something (On/Off/Running/Closed/Open)

Events should be at past tense eg (UserRegistered, ListHasLoaded, ButtonWasClicked)

Actions should be at imperative, aka giving orders/telling eg (StartOrder, CloseApplication, DisposeWaste)

So in the pokemon case it would be like this:

Hence State must describe something, lets consider our something to be the "Page" itself. Aka "State of the page":

State 1: "Empty Page"
    Invokes action (getPokemonList)
        Raises one of the events (Done - ListFetched / Error - FetchingFailed)
            If ListFetched      
                Transition To State 2:  "Page with Data"
            If FetchingFailed 
                Transition To State 3:  "Page with Error"

Thus we have:

States:  EmptyPage | PageWithData | PageWithError

Actions: getPokemonList

Events:  ListFetched | FetchingFailed

</pre>
        </div>
    </main>
</Layout>
